# Module 7 - Lab 1 - Exercise 7 - Create Detections

## Lab scenario


You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You are going to work with Log Analytics KQL queries and from there, you will create custom analytics rules to help discover threats and anomalous behaviors in your environment.

Analytics rules search for specific events or sets of events across your environment, alert you when certain event thresholds or conditions are reached, generate incidents for your SOC to triage and investigate, and respond to threats with automated tracking and reMediation processes.


### Task 1: Attack 1 Detection with Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will create a detection for **Attack 1** on the host with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configured.

1. On WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: Pa55w.rd.

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel portal, select **Logs** from the General section in case you navigated away from this page.

1. **Run** the following KQL Statement again to recall the tables where we have this data:

    ```KQL
    search "temp\\startup.bat"
    ```

1. This detection will focus on data from Defender for Endpoint. **Run** the following KQL Statement:

    ```KQL
    search in (Device*) "temp\\startup.bat"
    ```

1. The table *DeviceRegistryEvents* looks to have the data already normalized and easy for us to query. Expand the row to see all the columns related to the record.

    >**Important:** If you do not see the *DeviceRegistryEvents* table in the results, an alternative for the following queries is to use the *DeviceProcessEvents* table as replacement. Being that said, use one of the two provided examples below.

1. From the results, we now know that the Threat Actor is using reg.exe to add keys to the Registry key and the program is located in C:\temp. **Run** the following statement to replace the *search* operator with the *where* operator in our query:

    ```KQL
    DeviceRegistryEvents | where ActionType == "RegistryValueSet"
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName == "reg.exe"
    | where RegistryValueData startswith "c:\\temp"
    ```

1. Alternatively, you can **Run** the following KQL query using the *DeviceProcessEvents* table:

    ```KQL
    DeviceProcessEvents | where ActionType == "ProcessCreated"
    | where FileName == "reg.exe"
    | where ProcessCommandLine contains "c:\\temp"
    ```

1. It is important to help the Security Operations Center Analyst by providing as much context about the alert as you can. This includes projecting Entities for use in the investigation graph. **Run** the following query:

    ```KQL
    DeviceRegistryEvents
    | where ActionType == "RegistryValueSet"
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName == "reg.exe"
    | where RegistryValueData startswith "c:\\temp"
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = DeviceName, AccountCustomEntity = InitiatingProcessAccountName
    ```

1. Alternatively, you can **Run** the following KQL query using the *DeviceProcessEvents* table:

    ```KQL
    DeviceProcessEvents | where ActionType == "ProcessCreated"
    | where FileName == "reg.exe"
    | where ProcessCommandLine contains "c:\\temp"
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = DeviceName, AccountCustomEntity = InitiatingProcessAccountName
    ```

1. Now that you have a good detection rule, in the Logs window, select the **+ New alert rule** in the command bar and then select **Create Microsoft Sentinel alert**. This will create a new Scheduled rule.

1. This starts the "Analytics rule wizard". For the *General* tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**MDE Startup RegKey**|
    |Description|**MDE Startup Regkey in c:\temp**|
    |Tactics|**Persistence**|
    |Severity|**High**|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button.

1. On the *Set rule logic* tab, the *Rule query* should be populated already with you KQL query, as well as the entities under *Alert enrichment - Entity mapping*.

1. For *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Look data from the last|1 Day|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Leave the rest of the options with the defaults. Select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response >** button.

1. For the *Automated response* tab select the **PostMessageTeams-OnAlert** under *Alert automation* and then select **Next: Review** button.

1. On the *Review* tab, select the **Create** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.


### Task 2: Attack 2 Detection with SecurityEvent

In this task, you will create a detection for **Attack 2** on the host with the Security Events connector  installed.

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel portal, select **Logs** from the General section in case you navigated away from this page.

1. **Run** the following KQL Statement to identify any entry that refers to administrators:

    ```KQL
    search "administrators" | summarize count() by $table
    ```

1. The result might show events from different tables, but in our case, we want to investigate the SecurityEvent table. The EventID and Event that we are looking is "4732 - A member was added to a security-enabled local group". With this, we will identify adding a member to a privileged group. **Run** the following KQL query to confirm:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    ```

1. Expand the row to see all the columns related to the record. The username of the account added as Administrator does not show. The issue is that instead of storing the username, we have the Security IDentifier (SID). **Run** the following KQL to match the SID to the username that was added to the Administrators group:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    | extend Acct = MemberSid, MachId = SourceComputerId  
    | join kind=leftouter (
        SecurityEvent 
        | summarize count() by TargetSid, SourceComputerId, TargetUserName 
        | project Acct1 = TargetSid, MachId1 = SourceComputerId, UserName1 = TargetUserName) on $left.MachId == $right.MachId1, $left.Acct == $right.Acct1
    ```

   ![Screenshot](../Media/SC200_sysmon_attack3.png)

    >**Note:** This KQL might not return the expected results because of the small dataset used in the lab.

1. Extend the row to show the resulting columns, in the last one, we see the name of the added user under the *UserName1* column we *project* within the KQL query. It is important to help the Security Operations Analyst by providing as much context about the alert as you can. This includes projecting Entities for use in the investigation graph. **Run** the following query:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    | extend Acct = MemberSid, MachId = SourceComputerId  
    | join kind=leftouter (
        SecurityEvent 
        | summarize count() by TargetSid, SourceComputerId, TargetUserName 
        | project Acct1 = TargetSid, MachId1 = SourceComputerId, UserName1 = TargetUserName) on $left.MachId == $right.MachId1, $left.Acct == $right.Acct1
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = Computer, AccountCustomEntity = UserName1
    ```

1. Now that you have a good detection rule, in the Logs window, select **+ New alert rule** in the command bar and then select **Create Microsoft Sentinel alert**.

1. This starts the "Analytics rule wizard". For the *General* tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**SecurityEvent Local Administrators User Add**|
    |Description|**User added to Local Administrators group**|
    |Tactics|**Privilege Escalation**|
    |Severity|**High**|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button. 

1. On the *Set rule logic* tab, the *Rule query* should be populated already with you KQL query, as well the entities under *Alert enrichment - Entitiy mapping*.

1. For *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Look data from the last|1 Day|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Leave the rest of the options with the defaults. Select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response >** button.

1. For the *Automated response* tab select the **PostMessageTeams-OnAlert** under *Alert automation* and then select **Next: Review** button.

1. On the *Review* tab, select the **Create** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.
